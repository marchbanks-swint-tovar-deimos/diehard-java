#Colin's Exercises

1. Odd One Out
   Write a function that returns true if exactly one word in the array differs in length from the rest. Return false in all other cases.
   
   Examples
   oddOneOut(["silly", "mom", "let", "the"]) ➞ true
   
   oddOneOut(["swanky", "rhino", "moment"]) ➞ true
   
   oddOneOut(["the", "them", "theme"]) ➞ false
   
   oddOneOut(["very", "to", "an", "some"]) ➞ false
   Notes
   The length of the array will always have at least three or more words.
  
2. Is the Average of All Elements a Whole Number?
   Create a function that takes an array as an argument and returns true or false depending on whether the average of all elements in the array is a whole number or not.
   
   Examples
   isAvgWhole([1, 3]) ➞ true
   
   isAvgWhole([1, 2, 3, 4]) ➞ false
   
   isAvgWhole([1, 5, 6]) ➞ true
   
   isAvgWhole([1, 1, 1]) ➞ true
   
   isAvgWhole([9, 2, 2, 5]) ➞ false
